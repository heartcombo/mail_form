== MailForm

=== Rails 3

This gem was built on top of ActiveModel to showcase how you can pull in validations, naming
and i18n from Rails to your models without the need to implement it all by yourself.

In other words, this README refers to the MailForm gem to be used in Rails 3. For instructions
on how to use MailForm in Rails 2.x, please check the v1.0 branch:

  http://github.com/plataformatec/mail_form/tree/v1.0

=== Description

MailForm allows you to send an e-mail straight from a form. For instance,
if you want to make a contact form just the following lines are needed (including the e-mail):

  class ContactForm < MailForm::Base
    attribute :name,      :validate => true
    attribute :email,     :validate => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/
    attribute :file,      :attachment => true

    attribute :message
    attribute :nickname,  :captcha  => true

    # Declare the e-mail headers. It accepts anything the mail method
    # in ActionMailer accepts.
    def headers
      {
        :subject => "My Contact Form",
        :to => "your.email@your.domain.com",
        :from => %("#{name}" <#{email}>)
      }
    end
  end

Then you start a script/console and type:

  c = ContactForm.new(:name => 'José', :email => 'jose@email.com', :message => 'Cool!')
  c.deliver

Check your inbox and the e-mail will be there, with the sent fields (assuming that
you configured your mailer delivery method properly).

=== MailForm::Base

When you inherit from MailForm::Base, it pulls down a set of stuff from ActiveModel,
as ActiveModel::Validation, ActiveModel::Translation and ActiveModel::Naming.

This bring I18n, error messages, validations and attributes handling like in
ActiveRecord to MailForm, so MailForm can be used in your controllers and form builders without extra tweaks. This also means that instead of the following:

  attribute :email, :validate => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/

You could actually do this:

  attribute :email
  validates_format_of :email, :with => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/

Choose the one which pleases you the most. For more information on the API, please
continue reading below.

=== Playing together ORMs

MailForm plays nice with ORMs as well. You just need to include MailForm::Delivery
in your model and declare which attributes should be sent:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    include MailForm::Delivery

    append :remote_ip, :user_agent, :session
    attributes :name, :email, :created_at

    def headers
      {
        :to => "your.email@your.domain.com",
        :subject => "User created an account"
      }
    end
  end

The delivery will be triggered in an after_create hook.

== Installation

Install MailForm is very easy. It is stored in Gemcutter, so just run the following:

   sudo gem install mail_form

If you want it as plugin, just do:

   script/plugin install git://github.com/plataformatec/mail_form.git

== API Overview

=== attributes(*attributes)

Declare your form attributes. All attributes declared here will be appended
to the e-mail, except the ones :captcha is true.

Options:

* :validate - A hook to validates_*_of. When true is given, validates the
  presence of the attribute. When a regexp, validates format. When array,
  validates the inclusion of the attribute in the array.

  Whenever :validate is given, the presence is automatically checked. Give
  :allow_blank => true to override.

  Finally, when :validate is a symbol, the method given as symbol will be
  called. Then you can add validations as you do in ActiveRecord (errors.add).

* :attachment - When given, expects a file to be sent and attaches
  it to the e-mail. Don't forget to set your form to multitype.

* :captcha - When true, validates the attributes must be blank.
  This is a simple way to avoid spam and the input should be hidden with CSS.

Examples:

   class ContactForm < MailForm::Base
     attributes :name,  :validate => true
     attributes :email, :validate => /[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[\w\.\-]+/
     attributes :type,  :validate => ["General", "Interface bug"]
     attributes :message
     attributes :screenshot, :attachment => true, :validate => :interface_bug?
     attributes :nickname,   :captcha => true

     def interface_bug?
       if type == 'Interface bug' && screenshot.nil?
         self.errors.add(:screenshot, "can't be blank on interface bugs")
       end
     end
   end

   c = ContactForm.new(:nickname => 'not_blank', :email => 'your@email.com', :name => 'José')
   c.valid?  #=> true
   c.spam?   #=> true  (raises an error in development, to remember you to hide it)
   c.deliver  #=> false (just delivers if is not a spam and is valid, raises an error in development)

   c = ContactForm.new(:email => 'invalid')
   c.valid?               #=> false
   c.errors.inspect       #=> { :name => :blank, :email => :invalid }
   c.errors.full_messages #=> [ "Name can't be blank", "Email is invalid" ]

   c = ContactForm.new(:name => 'José', :email => 'your@email.com')
   c.create

=== append(*methods)

MailForm also makes easy to append request information from client to the sent
mail. You just have to do:

  class ContactForm < MailForm::Base
    append :remote_ip, :user_agent, :session
    # ...
  end

And in your controller:

  @contact_form = ContactForm.new(params[:contact_form])
  @contact_form.request = request

The remote ip, user agent and session will be sent in the e-mail in a
request information session. You can give to append any method that the
request object responds to.

== I18n

I18n in MailForm works like in ActiveRecord, so all models, attributes and messages
can be used with localized. Below is an I18n file example file:

  mail_form:
    models:
      contact_form: "Your site contact form"
    attributes:
      contact_form:
        email: "E-mail"
        telephone: "Telephone number"
        message: "Sent message"
    request:
      title: "Technical information about the user"
      remote_ip: "IP Address"
      user_agent: "Browser"
