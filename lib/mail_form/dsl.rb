      # Declare your form attributes. All attributes declared here will be appended
      # to the e-mail, except the ones captcha is true.
      #
      # == Options
      #
      # * <tt>:validate</tt> - When true, validates the attributes can't be blank.
      #   When a regexp is given, check if the attribute matches is not blank and
      #   then if it matches the regexp.
      #
      #   Whenever :validate is a symbol, the method given as symbol will be
      #   called. You can then add validations as you do in ActiveRecord (errors.add).
      #
      # * <tt>:attachment</tt> - When given, expects a file to be sent and attaches
      #   it to the e-mail. Don't forget to set your form to multitype.
      #
      # * <tt>:captcha</tt> - When true, validates the attributes must be blank
      #   This is a simple way to avoid spam

      # instance. By default is the class human name.
      #
      # == Examples
      #
      #   class ContactForm < MailForm
